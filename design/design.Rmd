## Design Discussion

Let Design 1 be notated as $d_1$ and Design 2 be notated as $d_2$.

### Minimum Aberration

The wordlength for Design 1 is $W = (0, 1, 0)$, whereas the wordlength for Design 2 is $W = (2, 1, 0)$, based on the defining relation for each of the designs.

Given the $d_1$ design of $2^{5-2}$ (quarter-fraction) and the $d_2$ design of $2^{5-1}$ (half-fraction), let $r$ be the smallest integer such that $A_{r}(d_1) \neq A_{r}(d_2)$, where $A_r(\cdot)$ is one element of the design's wordlength pattern.

Design $d_1$ has less aberration than design $d_2$, since $A_r(d_1) = 0 < 2 = A_r(d_2)$.  Minimum aberration is desirable. Therefore, $d_1$ has is desirable due to its minimum aberration.

### Clear and Strong Clear Effects

We define a main effect or two-factor interaction as clear if none of its aliases are main effects or two-factor interactions, and we define it as strong clear if none of its aliases are main effects, two-factor interactions, or three-factor interactions.

Consider the alias structures of both designs $d_1$ and $d_2$.

Design $d_1$ has the defining relation $I \equiv ABD \equiv ACE \equiv BCDE$. We get the following aliases with two-factor interactions.

$A \equiv BD \equiv CE (\equiv BCDE)$

$B \equiv AD (\equiv ACE \equiv CDE)$

$C \equiv AE (\equiv ABCD \equiv BDE)$

$D \equiv AB (\equiv ACDE \equiv BCE)$

$E \equiv AC (\equiv ABDE \equiv BCD)$

Observe how all main effects have an alias with a two-factor interaction. Therefore, none of the effects are strong clear.

Design $d_2$ has the defining relation $I \equiv ABCDE$. For each main effect, there are no aliases with two- or three-factor interactions. Therefore, each main effect is considered strong clear.

More factors which are strong clear contribute to a more desirable design. Therefore, design $d_2$ is more desirable due to its high number of strong clear factors.

### Design Considerations

Fries and Hunter (1980) established that not all $2^{k-p}$ designs of maximum resolution are equally desirable, and they introduced the minimum aberration criterion for further discriminating designs of the same resolution.
